# Sign-Language-Detector
Deaf and dumb cannot use spoken languages hence the only way for them to communicate is through sign language. These people make use of their hands to express
different gestures to express their ideas with other people. Gestures are the nonverbally exchanged messages and these gestures are understood with vision. This nonverbal communication of deaf and dumb people is called sign language. In our project we basically focus on producing a model which can recognise Fingerspelling based hand gestures in order to form a complete word by combining each gesture.
